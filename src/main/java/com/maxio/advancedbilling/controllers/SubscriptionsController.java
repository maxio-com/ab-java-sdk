     * + [Subscription
     * Reactivation](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252109503629-Reactivating-and-Resuming)
     * + [Subscription Import](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251489107213-Imports)
     * When creating a subscription, you must specify a product and a customer. Credit card details
     * may be required, depending on the options for the Product being subscribed ([see Product
     * Options](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261076617869-Product-Editing)). The
     * product may be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle). In similar
     * fashion, to pass a particular product price point, you may either use
     * `product_price_point_handle` or `product_price_point_id`. An existing customer may be
     * specified by a `customer_id` (ID within Advanced Billing) or a `customer_reference` (unique
     * value within your app that you have shared with Advanced Billing via the reference attribute
     * on a customer). You may also pass in an existing payment profile for that customer with
     * `payment_profile_id`. A new customer may be created by providing `customer_attributes`.
     * Credit card details may be required, depending on the options for the product being
     * subscribed. The product can be specified by `product_id` or by `product_handle` (API Handle).
     * If you are creating a subscription with a payment profile, the attribute to send will be
     * `credit_card_attributes` or `bank_account_attributes` for ACH and Direct Debit. That said,
     * when you read the subscription after creation, we return the profile details under
     * `credit_card` or `bank_account`. ## Bulk creation of subscriptions Bulk creation of
     * subscriptions is currently not supported. For scenarios where multiple subscriptions must be
     * added, particularly when assigning to the same subscription group, it is essential to switch
     * to a single-threaded approach. To avoid data conflicts or inaccuracies, incorporate a sleep
     * interval between requests. While this single-threaded approach may impact performance, it
     * ensures data consistency and accuracy in cases where concurrent creation attempts could
     * otherwise lead to issues with subscription alignment and integrity. ## Taxable Subscriptions
     * If your intent is to charge your subscribers tax via [Avalara
     * Taxes](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24287043035661-Avalara-VAT-Tax) or [Custom
     * Taxes](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24287044212749-Custom-Taxes), there are a
     * few considerations to be made regarding collecting subscription data. For subscribers to be
     * eligible to be taxed, the following information for the `customer` object or
     * `payment_profile` object must by supplied: + A subscription to a [taxable
     * product](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261076617869-Product-Editing#tax-settings)
     * + [Full valid billing or shipping
     * address](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24287008131853-Advanced-Billing-Managed-Sales-Tax#full-address-required-for-taxable-subscriptions)
     * to identify the tax locale + The portion of the address that houses the [state
     * information](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24287008131853-Advanced-Billing-Managed-Sales-Tax#required-state-format-for-taxable-subscriptions)
     * of either adddress must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2-3 character limit/format. + The
     * portion of the address that houses the [country
     * information](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24287008131853-Advanced-Billing-Managed-Sales-Tax#required-country-format-for-taxable-subscriptions)
     * must adhere to the ISO standard of a 2 character limit/format. ## Subscription Request
     * Examples The subscription examples below will be split into two sections. The first section,
     * "Subscription Customization", will focus on passing different information with a
     * subscription, such as components, calendar billing, and custom fields. These examples will
     * presume you are using a secure `chargify_token` generated by Chargify.js. The second section,
     * "Passing Payment Information", will focus on passing payment information into Advanced
     * Billing. Please be aware that &lt;b&gt;collecting and sending Advanced Billing raw card details
     * requires PCI compliance on your end&lt;/b&gt;; these examples are provided as guidance. If your
     * business is not PCI compliant, we recommend using Chargify.js to collect credit cards or bank
     * accounts. # Subscription Customization ## With Components Different components require
     * slightly different data. For example, quantity-based and on/off components accept
     * `allocated_quantity`, while metered components accept `unit_balance`. When creating a
     * subscription with a component, a `price_point_id` can be passed in along with the
     * `component_id` to specify which price point to use. If not passed in, the default price point
     * will be used. Note: if an invalid `price_point_id` is used, the subscription will still
     * proceed but will use the component's default price point. Components and their price points
     * may be added by ID or by handle. See the example request body labeled "Components By Handle
     * (Quantity-Based)"; the format will be the same for other component types. ## With Coupon(s)
     * Pass an array of `coupon_codes`. See the example request body "With Coupon". ## With Manual
     * Invoice Collection The `invoice` collection method works only on legacy Statement
     * Architecture. On Relationship Invoicing Architecture use the `remittance` collection method.
     * ## Prepaid Subscription A prepaid subscription can be created with the usual subscription
     * creation parameters, specifying `prepaid` as the `payment_collection_method` and including a
     * nested `prepaid_configuration`. After a prepaid subscription has been created, additional
     * funds can be manually added to the prepayment account through the [Create Prepayment
     * Endpoint](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/api-docs/7ec482de77ba7-create-prepayment).
     * Prepaid subscriptions do not work on legacy Statement Architecture. ## With Metafields
     * Metafields can either attach to subscriptions or customers. Metafields are popuplated with
     * the supplied metadata to the resource specified. If the metafield doesn't exist yet, it will
     * be created on-the-fly. ## With Custom Pricing Custom pricing is pricing specific to the
     * subscription in question. Create a subscription with custom pricing by passing pricing
     * information instead of a price point. For a custom priced product, pass the custom_price
     * object in place of `product_price_point_id`. For a custom priced component, pass the
     * `custom_price` object within the component object. Custom prices and price points can exist
     * in harmony on a subscription. # Passing Payment Information ## Subscription with Chargify.js
     * token The `chargify_token` can be obtained using
     * [Chargify.js](https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjE0NjAzNDI0-overview).
     * The token represents payment profile attributes that were provided by the customer in their
     * browser and stored at the payment gateway. The `payment_type` attribute may either be
     * `credit_card` or `bank_account`, depending on the type of payment method being added. If a
     * bank account is being passed, the payment attributes should be changed to
     * `bank_account_attributes`. ```json { "subscription": { "product_handle": "pro-plan",
     * "customer_attributes": { "first_name": "Joe", "last_name": "Smith", "email":
     * "j.smith{@literal @}example.com" }, "credit_card_attributes": { "chargify_token":
     * "tok_cwhvpfcnbtgkd8nfkzf9dnjn", "payment_type": "credit_card" } } } ``` ## Subscription with
     * vault token If you already have a customer and card stored in your payment gateway, you may
     * create a subscription with a `vault_token`. Providing the last_four, card type and expiration
     * date will allow the card to be displayed properly in the Advanced Billing UI. ```json {
     * "subscription": { "product_handle": "pro-plan", "customer_attributes": { "first_name": "Joe",

     * back to your site. It is not possible to use `action_link` in an iframe inside a custom
     * application. You have to redirect the customer directly to the `action_link`, then, to be
     * notified about the result, use `redirect_url` or `callback_url`. The final URL that you send
     * a customer to complete 3D Secure may resemble the following, where the first half is the
     * `action_link` and the second half contains a `redirect_url` and `callback_url`:
     * `https://mysite.chargify.com/3d-secure/pay_6gjofv7dlyrkpizlolsuspvtiu?one_time_token_id=123&amp;callback_url=https://localhost:4000&amp;redirect_url=https://yourpage.com`
     * ### Example Redirect Flow You may wish to redirect customers to different pages depending on
     * whether their SCA was performed successfully. Here's an example flow to use as a reference:
     * 1. Create a subscription via API; it requires 3DS 2. You receive a `gateway_payment_id` in
     * the `action_link` along other params in the response. 3. Use this `gateway_payment_id` to,
     * for example, connect with your internal resources or generate a session_id 4. Include 1 of
     * those attributes inside the `callback_url` and `redirect_url` to be aware which “session”
     * this applies to 5. Redirect the customer to the `action_link` with `callback_url` and
     * `redirect_url` applied 6. After the customer finishes 3DS authentication, we let you know the
     * result by making a request to applied `callback_url`. 7. After that, we redirect the customer
     * to the `redirect_url`; at this point the result of authentication is known 8. Optionally, you
     * can use the applied "msg" param in the `redirect_url` to determine whether it was successful
     * or not ## Subscriptions Import Subscriptions can be “imported” via the API to handle the
     * following scenarios: + You already have existing subscriptions with specific start and
     * renewal dates that you would like to import to Advanced Billing + You already have credit
     * cards stored in your provider’s vault and you would like to create subscriptions using those
     * tokens Before importing, you should have already set up your products to match your
     * offerings. Then, you can create Subscriptions via the API just like you normally would, but
     * using a few special attributes. Full documentation on how import Subscriptions using the
     * **import tool** in the Advanced Billing UI can be located
     * [here](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251489107213-Imports). ### Important
     * Notices and Disclaimers regarding Imports Before performing a bulk import of subscriptions
     * via the API, we suggest reading the [Subscriptions
     * Import](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251489107213-Imports) instructions to
     * understand the repurcussions of a large import. ### Subscription Input Attributes The
     * following _additional_ attributes to the subscription input attributes make imports possible:
     * `next_billing_at`, `previous_billing_at`, and `import_mrr`. ### Current Vault If you are
     * using a Legacy gateway such as "eWAY Rapid (Legacy)" or "Stripe (Legacy)" then please contact
     * Support for further instructions on subscription imports. ### Braintree Blue (Braintree v2)
     * Imports Braintree Blue is Braintree’s newer (version 2) API. For this gateway, please provide
     * the `vault_token` parameter with the value from Braintree’s “Customer ID” rather than the
     * “Payment Profile Token”. At this time we do not use `current_vault_token` with the Braintree
     * Blue gateway, and we only support a single payment profile per Braintree Customer. When
     * importing PayPal type payment profiles, please set `payment_type` to `paypal_account`. ###
     * Stripe ACH Imports If the bank account has already been verified, currently you will need to
     * create the customer, create the payment profile in Advanced Billing - setting verified=true,
     * then create a subscription using the customer_id and payment_profile_id. ### Webhooks During
     * Import If no `next_billing_at` is provided, webhooks will be fired as normal. If you do set a
     * future `next_billing_at`, only a subset of the webhooks are fired when the subscription is
     * created. Keep reading for more information as to what webhooks will be fired under which
     * scenarios. #### Successful creation with Billing Date Scenario: If `next_billing_at` provided
     * + `signup_success` + `billing_date_change` #### Successful creation without Billing Date
     * Scenario: If no `next_billing_at` provided + `signup_success` + `payment_success` ####
     * Unsuccessful creation Scenario: If card can’t be charged, and no `next_billing_at` provided +
     * signup_failure #### Webhooks fired when next_billing_at is reached: + `renewal_success or
     * renewal_failure` + `payment_success or payment_failure` ### Date and Time Formats We will
     * attempt to parse any string you send as the value of next_billing_at in to a date or time.
     * For best results, use a known format like described in “Date and Time Specification” of RFC
     * 2822 or ISO 8601 . The following are all equivalent and will work as input to
     * `next_billing_at`: ``` Aug 06 2030 11:34:00 -0400 Aug 06 2030 11:34 -0400
     * 2030-08-06T11:34:00-04:00 8/6/2030 11:34:00 EDT 8/6/2030 8:34:00 PDT 2030-08-06T15:34:00Z ```
     * You may also pass just a date, in which case we will assume the time to be noon ```
     * 2010-08-06 ``` ## Subscription Hierarchies &amp; WhoPays When subscription groups were first
     * added to our Relationship Invoicing architecture, to group together invoices for related
     * subscriptions and allow for complex customer hierarchies and WhoPays scenarios, they were
     * designed to consist of a primary and a collection of group members. The primary would control
     * many aspects of the group, such as when the consolidated invoice is generated. As of today,
     * groups still function this way. In the future, the concept of a "primary" will be removed in
     * order to offer more flexibility into group management and reduce confusion concerning what
     * actions must be done on a primary level, rather than a member level. We have introduced a two
     * scheme system as a bridge between these two group organizations. Scheme 1, which is relevant
     * to all subscription groups today, marks the group as being "ruled" by a primary. When reading
     * a subscription via API, they will return a top-level attribute called `group`, which will
     * denote which scheme is being used. At this time, the `scheme` attribute will always be 1. ###
     * Subscription in a Customer Hierarchy For sites making use of the [Relationship
     * Billing](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252287829645-Advanced-Billing-Invoices-Overview)
     * and [Customer
     * Hierarchy](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252185211533-Customer-Hierarchies-WhoPays)
     * features, it is possible to create subscriptions within a customer hierarchy. This can be
     * achieved through the API by passing group parameters in the **Create Subscription** request.
     * + The `group` parameters are optional and consist of the required `target` and optional
     * `billing` parameters. When the `target` parameter specifies a customer that is already part
     * of a hierarchy, the new subscription will become a member of the customer hierarchy as well.
     * If the target customer is not part of a hierarchy, a new customer hierarchy will be created
     * and both the target customer and the new subscription will become part of the hierarchy with
     * the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the hierarchy's subscriptions.
     * Rather than specifying a customer, the `target` parameter could instead simply have a value
     * of `self` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but
     * by the subscribing customer. This will be true whether the customer is being created new, is
     * already part of a hierarchy, or already exists outside a hierarchy. A valid payment method
     * must also be specified in the subscription parameters. Note that when creating subscriptions
     * in a customer hierarchy, if the customer hierarchy does not already have a payment method,
     * passing valid credit card attributes in the subscription parameters will also result in the
     * payment method being established as the default payment method for the customer hierarchy
     * irrespective of the responsible payer. The optional `billing` parameters specify how some
     * aspects of the billing for the new subscription should be handled. Rather than capturing
     * payment immediately, the `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription
     * charges accrue until the next assessment date. Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter
     * can be included so that the billing date of the new subscription matches up with the default
     * subscription group in the customer hierarchy. When choosing to align the dates, the `prorate`
     * parameter can also be specified so that the new subscription charges are prorated based on
     * the billing period of the default subscription group in the customer hierarchy also. ###
     * Subscription in a Subscription Group For sites making use of [Relationship
     * Billing](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252287829645-Advanced-Billing-Invoices-Overview)
     * it may be desireable to create a subscription as part of a [subscription
     * group](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252172565005-Subscription-Groups-Overview)
     * in order to rely on [invoice
     * consolidation](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252269909389-Invoice-Consolidation).
     * This can be achieved through the API by passing group parameters in the Create Subscription
     * request. The `group` parameters are optional and consist of the required `target` and
     * optional `billing` parameters. The `target` parameters specify an existing subscription with
     * which the newly created subscription should be grouped. If the target subscription is already
     * part of a group, the new subscription will become a member of the group as well. If the
     * target subscription is not part of a group, a new group will be created and both the target
     * and the new subscription will become part of the group with the target as the group's primary
     * subscription. The optional `billing` parameters specify how some aspects of the billing for
     * the new subscription should be handled. Rather than capturing payment immediately, the
     * `accrue` parameter can be included so that the new subscription charges accrue until the next
     * assessment date. Regarding the date, the `align_date` parameter can be included so that the
     * billing date of the new subscription matches up with the target subscription. When choosing
     * to align the dates, the `prorate` parameter can also be specified so that the new
     * subscription charges are prorated based on the billing period of the target subscription
     * also. ## Providing Agreement Acceptance Params It is possible to provide a proof of
     * customer's acceptance of terms and policies. We will be storing this proof in case it might
     * be required (i.e. chargeback). Currently, we already keep it for subscriptions created via
     * Public Signup Pages. In order to create a subscription with the proof of agreement
     * acceptance, you must provide additional parameters `agreement acceptance` with `ip_address`
     * and at least one url to the policy that was accepted: `terms_url` or `privacy_policy_url`.
     * Additional urls that can be provided: `return_refund_policy_url`, `delivery_policy_url` and
     * `secure_checkout_policy_url`. ```json "subscription": { "product_handle": "gold-product",
     * "customer_attributes": { "first_name": "Jane", "last_name": "Doe", "email":
     * "jd{@literal @}chargify.test" }, "agreement_acceptance": { "ip_address": "1.2.3.4", "terms_url":
     * "https://terms.url", "privacy_policy_url": "https://privacy_policy.url",
     * "return_refund_policy_url": "https://return_refund_policy.url", "delivery_policy_url":
     * "https://delivery_policy.url", "secure_checkout_policy_url":
     * "https://secure_checkout_policy.url" } } } ``` **For Maxio Payments subscriptions, the
     * agreement acceptance params are required, with at least terms_url provided.** ## Providing
     * ACH Agreement params It is also possible to provide a proof that a customer authorized ACH
     * agreement terms. The proof will be stored and the email will be sent to the customer with a
     * copy of the terms (if enabled). In order to create a subscription with the proof of
     * authorized ACH agreement terms, you must provide the additional parameter `ach_agreement`
     * with the following nested parameters: `agreement_terms`, `authorizer_first_name`,
     * `authorizer_last_name` and `ip_address`. Each of them is required. ```json "subscription": {
     * "product_handle": "gold-product", "customer_attributes": { "first_name": "Jane", "last_name":
     * "Doe", "email": "jd{@literal @}chargify.test" }, "bank_account_attributes": { "bank_name": "Test Bank",
     * "bank_routing_number": "021000089", "bank_account_number": "111111111111",
     * "bank_account_type": "checking", "bank_account_holder_type": "business", "payment_type":
     * "bank_account" }, "ach_agreement": { "agreement_terms": "ACH agreement terms",
     * "authorizer_first_name": "Jane", "authorizer_last_name": "Doe", "ip_address": "1.2.3.4" } }

    /**
     * The subscription endpoint allows you to instantly update one or many attributes about a
     * subscription in a single call. ## Update Subscription Payment Method Change the card that
     * your Subscriber uses for their subscription. You can also use this method to simply change
     * the expiration date of the card **if your gateway allows**. Note that partial card updates
     * for **Authorize.Net** are not allowed via this endpoint. The existing Payment Profile must be
     * directly updated instead. You also use this method to change the subscription to a different
     * product by setting a new value for product_handle. A product change can be done in two
     * different ways, **product change** or **delayed product change**. ## Product Change This
     * endpoint may be used to change a subscription's product. The new payment amount is calculated
     * and charged at the normal start of the next period. If you desire complex product changes or
     * prorated upgrades and downgrades instead, please see the documentation on Migrating
     * Subscription Products. To perform a product change, simply set either the `product_handle` or
     * `product_id` attribute to that of a different product from the same site as the subscription.
     * You can also change the price point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or
     * `product_price_point_handle` - otherwise the new product's default price point will be used.
     * ### Delayed Product Change This method also changes the product and/or price point, and the
     * new payment amount is calculated and charged at the normal start of the next period. This
     * method schedules the product change to happen automatically at the subscription’s next
     * renewal date. To perform a Delayed Product Change, set the `product_handle` attribute as you
     * would in a regular product change, but also set the `product_change_delayed` attribute to
     * `true`. No proration applies in this case. You can also perform a delayed change to the price
     * point by passing in either `product_price_point_id` or `product_price_point_handle` **Note:
     * To cancel a delayed product change, set `next_product_id` to an empty string.** ## Billing
     * Date Changes ### Regular Billing Date Changes Send the `next_billing_at` to set the next
     * billing date for the subscription. After that date passes and the subscription is processed,
     * the following billing date will be set according to the subscription's product period. Note
     * that if you pass an invalid date, we will automatically interpret and set the correct date.
     * For example, when February 30 is entered, the next billing will be set to March 2nd in a
     * non-leap year. The server response will not return data under the key/value pair of
     * `next_billing`. Please view the key/value pair of `current_period_ends_at` to verify that the
     * `next_billing` date has been changed successfully. ### Snap Day Changes For a subscription
     * using Calendar Billing, setting the next billing date is a bit different. Send the `snap_day`
     * attribute to change the calendar billing date for **a subscription using a product eligible
     * for calendar billing**. Note: If you change the product associated with a subscription that
     * contains a `snap_date` and immediately `READ/GET` the subscription data, it will still
     * contain evidence of the existing `snap_date`. This is due to the fact that a product change
     * is instantanous and only affects the product associated with a subscription. After the
     * `next_billing` date arrives, the `snap_day` associated with the subscription will return to
     * `null.` Another way of looking at this is that you willl have to wait for the next billing
     * cycle to arrive before the `snap_date` will reset to `null`.
     * @param  subscriptionId  Required parameter: The Chargify id of the subscription

     * @return    Returns the SubscriptionResponse response from the API call
     * @throws    ApiException    Represents error response from the server.
     * @throws    IOException    Signals that an I/O exception of some sort has occurred.

     * This API endpoint allows you to set certain subscription fields that are usually managed for
     * you automatically. Some of the fields can be set via the normal Subscriptions Update API, but
     * others can only be set using this endpoint. This endpoint is provided for cases where you
     * need to “align” Advanced Billing data with data that happened in your system, perhaps before
     * you started using Advanced Billing. For example, you may choose to import your historical
     * subscription data, and would like the activation and cancellation dates in Advanced Billing
     * to match your existing historical dates. Advanced Billing does not backfill historical events
     * (i.e. from the Events API), but some static data can be changed via this API. Why are some
     * fields only settable from this endpoint, and not the normal subscription create and update
     * endpoints? Because we want users of this endpoint to be aware that these fields are usually
     * managed by Advanced Billing, and using this API means **you are stepping out on your own.**
     * Changing these fields will not affect any other attributes. For example, adding an expiration
     * date will not affect the next assessment date on the subscription. If you regularly need to
     * override the current_period_starts_at for new subscriptions, this can also be accomplished by
     * setting both `previous_billing_at` and `next_billing_at` at subscription creation. See the
     * documentation on [Importing
     * Subscriptions](./b3A6MTQxMDgzODg-create-subscription#subscriptions-import) for more
     * information. ## Limitations When passing `current_period_starts_at` some validations are
     * made: 1. The subscription needs to be unbilled (no statements or invoices). 2. The value
     * passed must be a valid date/time. We recommend using the iso 8601 format. 3. The value passed
     * must be before the current date/time. If unpermitted parameters are sent, a 400 HTTP response
     * is sent along with a string giving the reason for the problem.
     * @param  subscriptionId  Required parameter: The Chargify id of the subscription
     * @param  body  Optional parameter: Only these fields are available to be set.
     * @throws    ApiException    Represents error response from the server.

     * [here](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview).
     * ## Side effects A subscription will not be created by sending a POST to this endpoint. It is
     * meant to serve as a prediction. ## Taxable Subscriptions This endpoint will preview taxes
     * applicable to a purchase. In order for taxes to be previewed, the following conditions must
     * be met: + Taxes must be configured on the subscription + The preview must be for the purchase
     * of a taxable product or component, or combination of the two. + The subscription payload must
     * contain a full billing or shipping address in order to calculate tax For more information
     * about creating taxable previews, please see our documentation guide on how to create [taxable
     * subscriptions.](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/sections/24287012349325-Taxes) You do
     * **not** need to include a card number to generate tax information when you are previewing a
     * subscription. However, please note that when you actually want to create the subscription,
     * you must include the credit card information if you want the billing address to be stored in
     * Advanced Billing. The billing address and the credit card information are stored together
     * within the payment profile object. Also, you may not send a billing address to Advanced
     * Billing without payment profile information, as the address is stored on the card. You can
     * pass shipping and billing addresses and still decide not to calculate taxes. To do that, pass
     * `skip_billing_manifest_taxes: true` attribute. ## Non-taxable Subscriptions If you'd like to
     * calculate subscriptions that do not include tax, please feel free to leave off the billing
     * information.

     * Advanced Billing offers the ability to activate awaiting signup and trialing subscriptions.
     * This feature is only available on the Relationship Invoicing architecture. Subscriptions in a
     * group may not be activated immediately. For details on how the activation works, and how to
     * activate subscriptions through the application, see [activation](#). The `revert_on_failure`
     * parameter controls the behavior upon activation failure. - If set to `true` and something
     * goes wrong i.e. payment fails, then Advanced Billing will not change the subscription's
     * state. The subscription’s billing period will also remain the same. - If set to `false` and
     * something goes wrong i.e. payment fails, then Advanced Billing will continue through with the
     * activation and enter an end of life state. For trialing subscriptions, that will either be
     * trial ended (if the trial is no obligation), past due (if the trial has an obligation), or
     * canceled (if the site has no dunning strategy, or has a strategy that says to cancel
     * immediately). For awaiting signup subscriptions, that will always be canceled. The default
     * activation failure behavior can be configured per activation attempt, or you may set a
     * default value under Config &gt; Settings &gt; Subscription Activation Settings. ## Activation
     * Scenarios ### Activate Awaiting Signup subscription - Given you have a product without trial
